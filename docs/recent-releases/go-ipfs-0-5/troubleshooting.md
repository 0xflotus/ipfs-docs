# Troubleshooting

<!-- Taken from https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QvqtZ4c6FnvfKPYb4oacQWCAE3qamaCUrx4gGvYARis/edit# -->

## What might break?

- If youâ€™re using IPFS as a library you need to upgrade to the new interfaces.
- If you have a node prior to version 0.4.20 - please upgrade! These nodes will be unstable and a performance issue for the network. Aka - they may drop connections, be unreliable, and maybe even crash!
- Ipfs-lite will be interoperabilidad with 0.5
- Js-ipfs nodes will no longer be able to read go-ipfs datastores - if your go-ipfs node reads a js-ipfs datastore it will upgrade it and no longer be compatible with js-ipfs.
- New QUIC protocol.
- When putting to the DHT times out to find the best nodes to put to, findProviders will now fail (vs incorrectly succeeding as it did before) after putting to the best available peers.

## Dropped connections

If you are running an IPFS node prior to version `0.4.20` you need to upgrade. These nodes will be unstable and cause performance issues for the network. They may drop connections, be unreliable, and frequently crash.

## IPFS/Libp2p address format changes

If you were using a multiaddr library (go, js, etc.) to name files because `/ipfs/QmSomePeerID` looks like `/ipfs/QmSomeFile`, your tool may break if you upgrade this library. If you're manually parsing multiaddrs and are searching for the string `/ipfs/...` , you'll need to search for `/p2p/...`.

## Curl requests failing

The gateway will redirect from `http://localhost:5001/ipfs/CID/...` to `http://CID.ipfs.localhost:5001/...` by default. Curl doesn't follow redirects by default. To avoid breaking cURL and other clients that don't support redirects, Go-IPFS will return the requested file along with the redirect. Browsers will follow the redirect and abort the download while cURL will ignore the redirect and finish the download.

## Minimum RSA key size

IPFS now enforces a minimum key size of 2048. IPFS generates 2048 bit RSA keys by default so this shouldn't be an issue for most people. However, users who explicitly chose a smaller key size will not be able to communicate with new nodes.
