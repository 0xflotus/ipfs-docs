# Overview

It's been a while since the last Go-IPFS release, and with good reason. We've packed an incredible amount of bug fixes, improvements, and features into this build; it's the biggest Go-IPFS release since we first started the project.

<!-- There's lots of stuff here. List off all the new features. -->

<!-- It's going to make things much easier. Show some quality-of-life improvements we've added. -->

<!-- A bunch of issues that previous plauged IPFS are now gone with this release. Talk about some important bugs that got squashed. -->

<!-- Everything is more stable now. Point out the approx release schedule, and what our next goals are. -->
