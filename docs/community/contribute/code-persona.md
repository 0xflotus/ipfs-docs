# Code persona

Docs can be confusing, especially for complex technical stuff like IPFS. There are lots of moving parts and it's easy to get confused. Example use-cases and code-blocks often serve to make things easier to understand, and give the reader a chance to deal with things in a more hands-on approach. The issue is creating examples that are consistent.

Examples that come from different use-cases and projects make it harder to the reader to understand the topic at hand. The solution: **create a theme for all examples to be based off**.

Having a single theme keeps code examples self-contained and consistent. It doesn't make the problems any less complicated or technical, but it makes the reader have to think less. The reader doesn't have to spend time thinking about the larger project at hand or the end goal of everything if the main example project is something they're already familiar with.

## The theme

The _interplanitary_ part of _interplanitary file system_ comes with obvious space connotations, so it makes sense that example use-cases and code blocks are based around the final fontier.
