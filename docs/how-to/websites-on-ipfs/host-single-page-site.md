In this tutorial you'll import a simple one-page website to IPFS, have it use the CloudFlare Content Delivery Network (CDN), and link up a domain name so people can find your site easily.

### Windows

1. Go to the [IPFS desktop downloads page](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/releases).

The IPFS desktop application is now installed. You can now start to [add your site](#add-your-site).

### MacOS

### Linux

## Add your site

The next step is to import your site into IPFS using the IPFS desktop app you just installed. The website we'll be using is incredibly simple. The purpose of it is to generate a random Hobbit-like name and display it to the visitor. Each time the page is refreshed a new name is displayed. The website is creativly called _Hobbit name generator_.

1. Create a file called `index.html` and paste in the following code:

    ```html
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Hobbit Name Generator</title>
        <meta name="description" content="A Hobbit name generator, based of J.R.R Tolkien's 'Middle Earth'.">
        <meta name="author" content="IPFS">
        <style>body{margin:15px auto;max-width:650px;line-height:1.6;font-size:18px;color:#444;padding:0}</style>
    </head>
    <body onload="main()">
        <h1>Hobbit Name Generator</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Your Hobbit name is: <b id="output_p"></b></p>
        <script>const first_names=["Abbo","Balbo","Caradas","Dado","Ebbo","Falco","Gararic","Humbert","Isumbras","Jolly","Kalimac","Lotho","Moro","Nordbert","Otto","Ponto","Rothad","Suger","Tassilo","Uffo","Vigor","Wulfram","Zwentibold","Achilla","Begona","Cosma","Dora","Estella","Forsythia","Goldilocks","Hyacynth","Iris","Jasmina","Kalmia","Lalia","Myrtle","Nigella","Opal","Primula","Ruellia","Silene","Tulip","Viola","Zinnia"];const last_names=["Boffin","Chubb","Diggle","Fairbairn","Galbasi","Harfoot","Lightfoot","Mugwort","Noaks","Oldbuck","Proudfoot","Roper","Sackville","Took","Underhill","Whitfoot","Zaragamba"];function main(){let name=first_names[Math.floor(Math.random()*first_names.length)]+" "+last_names[Math.floor(Math.random()*last_names.length)];document.querySelector('#output_p').innerHTML=name}
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

2. Open IPFS desktop and go to the **Files** page.
3. Click **Add** â†’ **File**.

7. Open a browser and paste in the URL you just copied.

After a few moments your browser will load the website! This can take up to a few minutes the first time. You can move onto the next section while the site is loading.
