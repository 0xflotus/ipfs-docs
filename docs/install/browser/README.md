# IPFS browser companion

This add-on enables everyone to access IPFS resources the way they were meant: from locally running IPFS node :-)

IPFS is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

Learn more at [ipfs.io](https://ipfs.io/) (it is really cool, we promise!)
